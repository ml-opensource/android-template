 * Launches and runs the given [block] in a coroutine when `this` [LifecycleOwner]'s [Lifecycle]
 * is at least at [state]. The launched coroutine will be cancelled when the lifecycle state falls

 *
 * The [block] will cancel and re-launch as the lifecycle moves in and out of the target state.
 * To permanently remove the work from the lifecycle, [Job.cancel] the returned [Job].
 *
 * ```
 * // Runs the block of code in a coroutine when the lifecycleOwner is at least STARTED.
 * // The coroutine will be cancelled when the ON_STOP event happens and will restart executing
 * // if the lifecycleOwner's lifecycle receives the ON_START event again.
 * lifecycleOwner.addRepeatingJob(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {

 *
 * The best practice is to call this function when the lifecycleOwner is initialized. For
 * example, `onCreate` in an Activity, or `onViewCreated` in a Fragment. Otherwise, multiple
 * repeating jobs doing the same could be registered and be executed at the same time.
 *
 * Warning: [Lifecycle.State.INITIALIZED] is not allowed in this API. Passing it as a

 * will cancel if the lifecycle falls below that state, and will restart if it's in that state
