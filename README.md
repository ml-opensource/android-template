## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you start 

Before you start using the template, you probably want to install the [Jetpack Compose UI Architecture Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19034-jetpack-compose-ui-architecture-templates) on Android Studio.

This plugins facilitates the work when creating new Compose screens.

After installing, creating new features in the correct template structure should be as easy as doing the following:

**1 - Select the "New feature" option**

**2 - Name your new feature**

**3 - The correct folder structure should be created for you**

## Project Structure
Android template project has three top-level packages: `core`, `designsystem` and `features`. Overall package structure looks like following
- `core`
  - `extensions`
  - `injection`
  - `network`
  - `persistence`
  - `ui`
- `designsystem`
  - `components`
  - `theme`
- `features`
  - `nstack`
  - `feature1`
    - `data`
    - `domain`  
    - `injection`
    - `ui`
  
### `core` package
Core package is meant to be Domain-agnostic. It means that it should never reference anything project specific. Instead, it serves as a home for components that can be part of any project. This includes extensions on Kotlin Classes, Utility classes, Base classes, Compose layouts and Compose Effects and Modifiers that are behavioural rather then UI emitting

### `designsystem` package
The design system package contains the building blocks  for your application's UI. The main thing you will find here is `Theme`. This template is using custom `Theme` provider for Jetpack Compose while having `Material Theme` as its foundation. This allows to tweak `Colors` and `Typography` so it reflects actual Design System that is used on the project and supply custom properties like `Dimensions`

Another part of the design system are components. Examples of `designsystem` components are Buttons, TopBars, TextFields and so on. The template provides `AppButton` `AppTextField` and `AppTopBar` that you can modify and tweak and use throughout the project. [Learn more about design system here](./docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)


### `features` package
Features package contains the most important part of any project. A Feature typically contains all the necessary code(and resources + assets if migrated to multi module) required to implement a specific application functionality, such as a login screen, shopping cart, or authentication.  It may also have its own sets of dependencies, like third-party libraries or other features. [Each feature is following Clean Architecture Principles and has a three-layer split](#architecture)



## Architecture
Template implements [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and follows [best practices](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) provided by Google with some tweaks here and there

### Presentation layer
In our Android world, the Presentation layer or UI Layer is our Activities, Fragments, Jetpack Compose UI screens and components and ViewModels. The Presentation layer interacts with Domain Layer where our business logic happens.

### Domain layer
The domain layer contains the application's business logic. This layer should only work with abstractions and as such it would never know about how different layers look like. It shouldn‚Äôt know about any Databases, APIs, or even Android Framework.

### Data layer
The data layer is where the actual interactions happen between different data sources. This layer ‚Äúimplements‚Äù parts of the Domain layer and communicates with the APIs, Databases, and other services and SDKs.

## Flavors

- **Dev**: Intende for developers use only. Usually will have the same endpoints as staging. This have LeakCanary to help detect leaks.
- **Staging**: Intended for QA and internal testing. This usually have api endpoint for a testing server.
- **Release**: Intended for release. This version usually have live endpoint and signed builds.

## Tools
These are the tools used in the template, to improve the development, that you should be aware of:

### [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
Spotless is a Gradle plugin used to format source files. You can use it running the following Gradle commands:

`./gradlew spotlessCheck` - Checks the style formatting and displays any issues

`./gradlew spotlessApply` - Same as above but automatically try to fix most of the issues. If for any reason it can't, then a list of problems is displayed.


### [Chucker](https://github.com/ChuckerTeam/chucker)
Chucker is a HTTP inspector to help check the api calls when the app is being executed, this is helpful for both devs and QAs to analyse the trafic data. It should show as a notification when the app is ran. Note that is uses an `Interceptor` in the `OkHttpClient` to get the data, so if you need to create a new `OkHttpClient` for any reason, remember to also add the Chucker's `Interceptor`.

### [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/)
LeakCanary is a memory detectiong library that will automatically run in `devDebug` builds. It will automatically detect memory leaks and in case anything is found a notification will be shown. After that the details of the leak can be viweed both by clicking the notification on in the Logcat. This is intended for devs to spot and fix any leaks as early as possible.
